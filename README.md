# Kernel_PCA
PCA is a linear method. That is it can only be applied to datasets which are linearly separable. It does an excellent job for datasets, which are linearly separable. But, if we use it to non-linear datasets, we might get a result which may not be the optimal dimensionality reduction. Kernel PCA uses a kernel function to project dataset into a higher dimensional feature space, where it is linearly separable. It is similar to the idea of Support Vector Machines.
